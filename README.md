The folder contains the coding task of this issue: https://gitlab.com/listenfield/research/common_research/-/issues/757 (the presentation slide to be created may be put in this folder)

1. **data/raw-data folder:** this subfolder contain 10 .csv spreadsheets of the yields of 12 Thai rice varieties (only in-season rice considered), reported separately for ech of 77 Thailand provinces. One sheet is for one year, and the years range from 2012-2021. This data were put in one google spreadsheet ([[Raw]_Thailand rice yield data by provice and variety 2012-2021](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GM__1KpQWSaBTxAniNGshY5eKudSaCss8V-Pj4-XPQ8/edit#gid=775553303)) by the past intern. 

2. **TrendsfromTenYears.Rmd:** the file aim to use the 10 .csv spreadsheets of the yields in the raw-data folder for elucidate 
the general questions: what cultivars have been most grown and produced and what has given the best yield over the past 10 years, at the country-level and regional level. Moreover, specific questions to our LF work scope has been answered in this file: for our focused rice cultivars in the past, did we choose the suitable province for study (i.e. will studying this cultivar in this province have a high impact in terms of yield or production improvement).

3. **TrendsfromTenYears.html:** the knitted version of the TrendsfromTenYears.Rmd (updated)
